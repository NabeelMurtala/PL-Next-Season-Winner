## Task 1: Web Scraping & Data Analysis

### skills : basic ML & Data Analysis

*Predict the winner of the Premier League  for the current season based on the details of the last season's performance and current market value for each team*

*(it's a bonus of you have any other features to extract and train the model on it to get the best accuracy)*

- find a website on the internet to extract your data from `\webscraping`
- after extracting the appropriate features, save it in a CSV, EXSL, or JSON at `\data` dir
- train your model based on the extracted data to predict the next winner for the PL this season at `\model` 




NOTE: using open-source data files that are ready to use is not allowed, while the main purpose of this task is to extract the data from webapps, find the proper features for the task, and start to implement on an ML model
